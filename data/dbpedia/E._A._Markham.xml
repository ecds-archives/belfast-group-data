    <dbpedia-owl:abstract xml:lang="en">Edward Archie Markham FRSL (1 October 1939 – 23 March 2008) was a poet and writer, born in Harris, Montserrat, and mainly resident in the United Kingdom from 1956. Known for poetry in both "nation language" and standard English, for short stories and a comic novel, he sometimes used the pseudonym Paul St. Vincent and other personae, and defies simple classification as an author. He edited two significant collections of Caribbean writing, and several literary magazines. His first work was in drama. His family was large and relatively prosperous. He attended grammar school in Montserrat, and read English and philosophy at the University of Wales, Lampeter. He started academic research into seventeenth-century comedy at the University of East Anglia, and then in London. In 1969, while lecturing at Kilburn Polytechnic, he formed the Caribbean Theatre Troupe, which toured Montserrat, Saint Vincent and other parts of the Eastern Caribbean. They performed The Private Life of the Public Man and Dropping Out is Violence. He then worked in France for two years. His "Lambchops" poems, written as Paul St. Vincent, started to appear in the mid-1970s, and assume the perspective of a young urban Caribbean man. He would also use the voices of Sally Goodman, a Welsh feminist, Philpot and Maureen, and the character of Pewter Stapleton, an unimpressive academic, in his novel and stories. He built up a reputation gradually as a poet, through small press and chapbook publication. He joined for a time the performers The Bluefoot Travellers. In the later 1970s he taught in Manchester, then had writing fellowships in Hull and London (on a C. Day-Lewis Fellowship). In a long itinerant period he took a position for two years (1983-5) in Papua New Guinea, working for Enga province in the town of Wabag, where his gifts would not yet have been irrelevant, the nearby high school still maintaining high standards and the public library not yet having virtually all books stolen for their pages to be used for rolling cigarettes. He followed that with two years editing Artrage, the magazine of the Minority Arts Advisory Service. He spent 1988-91 at the University of Ulster as a writer-in-residence; he edited Writing Ulster. He also lived in Germany and Sweden, and in Britain, in Ipswich and Newcastle upon Tyne. He served in both the Poetry Society and Poetry Book Society. He was awarded the Certificate of Honour by the government of Montserrat, in 1997. As Professor of Creative Writing at Sheffield Hallam University (beginning 1997), a position he held until his death, he directed the Hallam Literature Festival. He also edited Sheffield Thursday magazine, and ran its competitions for poetry and short stories. Markham died of a heart attack in Paris, France, on Easter day, 23 March 2008, at the age of 69.</dbpedia-owl:abstract>
