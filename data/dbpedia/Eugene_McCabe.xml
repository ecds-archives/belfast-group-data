    <dbpedia-owl:abstract xml:lang="en">Eugene McCabe (born 1930) is an Irish novelist, short story writer, playwright and television screenwriter. He was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to Irish emigrants, but moved with his family to Ireland in the early 1940s. He lives on a farm near Clones in County Monaghan near the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. His play King of the Castle caused a minor scandal when first shown in 1964 and was protested by The League of Decency. McCabe wrote his award-winning trilogy of television plays, consisting of Cancer, Heritage and Siege because he felt he had to make a statement about The Troubles. His 1992 novel, Death and Nightingales has been called by Irish writer Colm Tóibín "one of the great Irish masterpieces of the century" and a "classic of our times" by Kirkus Reviews.</dbpedia-owl:abstract>
