Kavanagh has written four novels for adults and two for children. His first, A Song and Dance, was awarded the Guardian Fiction Prize in 1968. He was a columnist for The Spectator from 1983 to 1996 and then for The Times Literary Supplement until 2002. In 1992 his Collected Poems were published and in the same year he was given the Cholmondeley Award for poetry.
