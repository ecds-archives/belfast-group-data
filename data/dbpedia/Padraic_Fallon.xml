    <dbpedia-owl:abstract xml:lang="en">Padraic Fallon (1905 - 1974) was an Irish poet who was born in Athenry, County Galway, and later moved to Dublin to work as a civil servant. Here he became friends with the poet AE George William Russell who encouraged him as a writer and was the first to print his poems. Padraic Fallon also formed friendships with Seumas O'Sullivan and Patrick McDonogh. He later left Dublin to spend over twenty years as a Customs and Excise official in County Wexford where he lived and farmed with his wife, Dorothea, and his six sons. In 1950, the first of Fallon's verse plays for radio, Diarmuid and Grainne, was broadcast over Radio Eireann. It was followed by The Vision of Mac Conglinne, Steeple Jerkin, The Poplar and others, all of which were hailed by critics as landmarks both in Irish broadcasting and modern Irish writing. A stage play the Seventh Step was performed by The Globe Theatre in Dublin in 1954; another stage play, Sweet Love Till Morn was mounted at the Abbey Theatre in 1970. Several of these poetic plays were later performed on BBC3, in Germany and Holland, and more recently on Budapest radio. While many of his poems had previously appeared in anthologies, periodicals such as The Dublin Magazine' and in newspapers such as the Irish Times, his first book, Collected Poems, only appeared in 1974, the very year that he died. Poems and Versions was published posthumously in 1983 (Carcanet/Raven). A number of Fallon's verse plays has since been published posthumously by the Carcanet Press, while a volume of his prose writings and criticism (entitled A Poet's Journal) has been published by the Lilliput Press.</dbpedia-owl:abstract>
